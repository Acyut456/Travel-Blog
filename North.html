   <p> Doodhpathri ("Valley of Milk") is a secluded and undeveloped bowl-shaped valley that only recently opened to tourism. This makes it perfect if you're looking for an offbeat destination to enjoy pristine nature near Srinagar. The valley's name is often attributed to the legend of Kashmiri saint Sheikh Noor din Noorani, who is said to have been looking for water to wash himself with. When he broke the ground with his stick, milk came rushing out and later changed to water. Some say the river has a milky appearance.</p></li>

   <h1 style="font-size:30px;"> Mahabalipuram </h1>
   <img src="mahabalipuram.JPG" width=500px height=500px> 
   <p> Famous for its intricately carved temples and rock-cut caves, Mamallapuram or Mahabalipuram as it is famously known, is a historically important and well-loved tourist location situated on the Coromandel Coast along the Bay of Bengal, in the state of Tamil Nadu. Once the abode of the famous demon king Mahabali, Mahabalipuram was later renamed Mamallapuram. 
   Some famous tourist spots include the UNESCO world heritage site Group of Monuments like the Shore Temple and the Five Rathas.</p></li>
   
    <li>
   <h1 style="font-size:30px;"> Puducherry </h1>
   <img src="pudu.JPG" width=500px height=500px>  <img src="pudu1.JPG" width=500px height=500px>
   <p> Pondicherry, officially known as Puducherry, and commonly referred to as just Pondy, is one of the seven Union Territories of India which is bounded by the southern state of Tamil Nadu. This former French colony is a perfect amalgamation of the traditional Indian sensibilities and French architecture, making it a dreamy escape that offers the best of both worlds.
      The streets of the French Quarter of Pondicherry, also known as White Town, are dotted with charming mustard-yellow colonial structures with bougainvillaea laden walls.</p></li>
